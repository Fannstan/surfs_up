# surfs_up

## Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to examine the temperature trends on the island of Oahu, HI for the months of June and December.  Getting temperature data for both the summer and winter months will help determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round.  

## Results
### June:

- The minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees where the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, showing an 8 degree difference. 
- The average temperature in June is 74.9 degrees and the average temperature in December is 71 degrees, only a 4 degree difference. 
- The max temperature in June is 85 degrees and the max temperature in December is 83 degrees, only a 2 degree difference. 

## Summary 
The results show that June as would be expected is a warmer month than December, however, the temperature differences between June and December are not that large.  There is only a 4 degree difference in average temperatures for the two months, and the maximum temperature for December is only two degrees cooler than that shown in June. It would be a good idea to gather more weather data to help determine whether business for surfing and ice cream sales would be sustainable year round. Additional queries that may be helpful would be to gather temperature data for spring and fall months, such as March and September.  Another helpful query would be to show precipitation amounts for each of the seasons (amounts collected March, June, September, and December).  It would even be beneficial to query further if possible, to determine if precipitation is occuring in the daylight hours. If precipitaiton is occuring mostly at night, then it most likely won't affect surf and ice cream business.
